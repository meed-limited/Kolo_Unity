## What is micro-funding?
Micro funding is a type of funding offered to self-employed individuals and small business owners by individuals.

## Funds
Where does the money for the funds come from? The money for the loan may come from one person or may be collected from several people who will each contribute to the total amount. In the case of Kolo, the money is generated from ads and converted into USDC, and stored.
The DAO decides how the funds are used and distributed among all projects.

## The DAO
The requirement to be a member of the DAO is just to have a minimum of 1 KOL. Using the KOLO app allows users to collect points to get KOL Tokens. The more KOL Tokens a user has, the more vote power they have.

## Why Blockchain?
The investment cycle and actions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring security and transparency.

## What kind of projects are supported?
As KOLO aims to democratize opportunities, any entrepreneurial projects such as  farming or any small businesses in need of a small investment to start or to grow can apply. The list of requirements is important and communication is the key to success.
